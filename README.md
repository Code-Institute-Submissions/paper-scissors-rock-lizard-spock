# Project Overview

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie.
